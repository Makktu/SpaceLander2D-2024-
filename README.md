Ok. This time.

Slowly adding back the things that were in the Godot3 build, without the spaghetti code and organisation.

Refined the movement. Added a dynamic camera that zooms out when player is flying at speed and zooms in close when player is flying slowly. Added a first draft of parallax starry backgroud(s). Not happy with the images at this stage.

Inserted 3x size world by reusing the same image for each section of the world, but rotated 90/180 degrees.
